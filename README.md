jQueryUpload
============

A simple jQuery driven file upload form, with php handling the file processing. Very simple example.

TODO:

* Update $FILE to include special handling for cleaning the upload, to prevent bad data coming in.
* Do something cool with a connection to a database, to store transaction histories.
* Hardening the form with filters, and other cool stuff to make the form safe from bots, or worse.
